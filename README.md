# RegressionHelp
I made this to assist people that may be familiar with regression in R, but not sure how to do this in Python.
I may also do a different guide helping people do the opposite.

The dataset used is the [Auction Verification Dataset from UCI Repository](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auction+verification).

The documents `py_regression` are the guide targeted to people familiar with R. Both contain the same information, but are in different formats.
